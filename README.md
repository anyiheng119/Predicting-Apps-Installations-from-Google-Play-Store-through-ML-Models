# Predicting Apps Installations from Google Play Store through Machine Learning Models

## This is my Capstone project at UCLA Extension Data Science Intensive

With more than 2 billion active users, the Google Play platform has become one of the most attractive and competitive market of Android App development. Millions of developers and data-driven businesses need actionable insights to capture their market strategically. Data from Google Play Store has enormous potential to empower them to success.

In this project, I would like to know what do the most popular Apps look like? Can we build a ML system to predict how popular an App will be? Here I use the Web scraped [data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)  of 10k Google Play Store Apps for exploring the Android market.

More material will be uploaded through time. It is not surprising to see typos; please email me if you find any (anyiheng11@ucla.edu).
